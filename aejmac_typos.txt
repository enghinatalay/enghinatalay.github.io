There are two sets of typos in the online appendix. 

First, appendix B.1 refers to the ``Census of Manufacturers.'' This should be the ``Census of Manufactures.''

Second, the section references from the appendix to the body of the paper are off by one section, and uses Arabic instead of Roman numerals. For instance, the title for Appendix D is ``Sensitivity analysis related to Section 3.'' This should be  Sensitivity analysis related to Section II.''
