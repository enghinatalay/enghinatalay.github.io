There are two sets of typos in the online appendix. 

First, appendix B.1 refers to the ``Census of Manufacturers.'' This should be the ``Census of Manufactures.''

Second, the section references from the appendix to the body of the paper are off by one section and use Arabic numerals instead of Roman numerals. For instance, the title for Appendix D is ``Sensitivity analysis related to Section 3.'' This should be ``Sensitivity analysis related to Section II.'' A similar error occurs in footnote 36, on page 44, on page 67, and on page 69.
